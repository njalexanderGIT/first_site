<h2>Rocky</h2>

<p>
    Rocky is a 5 year old corgi. He prefers going for a jog than lounging around the house. Heâ€™s full of energy and loves to show his affection by snuggling up next to me while watching some Netflix.
</p>

<p>
    One thing I definitely overlooked when we got Rocky was the amount this little guy could shed! I spent an hour vacuuming our carpet floors just the day after he entered our homes! However, I would vacuum up and down the walls of our home for him, my life-long pal and good boy.
