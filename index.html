<h2>Rocky</h2>

<div class = "img_info">
<img src = "../images/corgi.jpg" alt = "Smiling corgi against plain white background" width = "400">

<p>
    Rocky is a 5 year old corgi. He prefers going for a jog than lounging around the house. Heâ€™s full of energy and loves to show his affection by snuggling up next to me while watching some Netflix. One thing I definitely overlooked when we got Rocky was the amount this little guy could shed! I spent an hour vacuuming our carpet floors just the day after he entered our homes! However, I would vacuum up and down the walls of our home for him, my life-long pal and good boy.

    <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>
    <div class = "img_info">
    <img src="../images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

    <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them. At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>

    <h2>York</h2>
    <div class = "img_info">
            <img src = "../images/york.jpg" width = 400 alt = "He is a large Black German Shepherd."/>

            <p>York loves to stay active by taking long walks near his house. He also enjoys chewing on his large assortment of toys with his favorite being his squeaky pig. York's favorite food is sausage, but cheese is another favorite. York is a very sociable dog and is a licensed therapy dog. He frequently visits nursing homes and other places in an attempt to raise peoples' spirits. When it comes to bedtime, York prefers to sleep alone in his favorite blue dog bed. He will always be the first to get up in the morning.</p>

            <p>Jingle loves going outside. He used to be an outdoor/indoor cat until we realized that he loved to get injured. Now, we take him on walks with a leash which he loves! Every time he sees me carrying the leash he goes crazy and meows to go out. Jingle is very mischievous, he has gotten into many different accidents. His first accident was outside; a bee stung his paw and he cried all night long. The second one was ALSO outside, he got stuck on a tree for four days. Finally, he came back home one day with his tail bleeding and ripped out.</p>

            <p>Maui is a two-year-old mini-doodle who thinks he is as big as a German shepherd. This mindset allows him to voice his opinion, especially when demanding food or attention. He is also a classic momma's boy, as he has learned if he is annoying enough, he can get anything he demands. During his lounging time, he gets to the highest chair he can get on and stares outside, waiting either for guests or belly rubs. He also has the tendency to force his mother to go to sleep as soon as his father goes to bed.</p>

            <p>
                Chief is a 9 year old pomeranian who loves to sleep as much as he can. He naps anywhere, ranging from someone's bed to the grass outside. He enjoys walking outside, but keep watch of him, otherwise he will try to consume geese poop. He does not like any toys anymore as when he was younger, he watched a bigger toy shred his favorite one to pieces. He used to know how to roll over, but now replaced that memory with a spin as it is much easier.

            <p>Cooky is an 11 month old Bernedoodle. He likes to play, run around, go on walks, eat snacks and treats (not his own dog food), get pets and belly rubs, and cuddle. You can usually find him playing with his toys in the living room, chilling in the office room with my dad, or cooling off in the garage. Hes still a baby, but he can get super hyper. Whenever someone rings the doorbell, Cooky gets really excited, barking and dashing towards the front door. He also jumps really high when hes hyper and wags his tail like crazy. Overall, though, he likes to chill and cuddle just as much as he likes to play.</p>

            <p>Finn is a 7 year old grey cat. I feel like no one really knows cat breeds so Im just gonna go with grey. He loves doing tricks for treats and his favorite is giving high fives to people. He might as well be a dog as he loves the outdoors and meeting new people. I can only describe him as goofy and chaotic. Finns biggest enemy is his vet. I don't know whether or not its because his vet is an MSU alum, but he doesnt like him. He actually has to be prescribed a sedative before he goes to the vet office because he will suddenly act like he was never a house cat for 7 years.</p>

            <p>When Daisy is not busy slaying all of the evil snakes trying to attack us (Pictured Above), you can usually find her annoying her older sister Marina, getting super hyper at completely random times, or relaxing in our backyard making sure she keeps out all of the intruders (squirrels). One of Daisys favorite things to do is beg to go on a walk, and then once we are about half way done with the walk she likes to lay down and refuse to keep going. She then loves being carried all the way back from said walk, and the process will repeat again later in the day.</p>
